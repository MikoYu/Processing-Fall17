# Programming Project 2 - Anonymity
#CCA/Semester/17fall #CCA/IxDFDN/Programming

## Description
This processing program will be shown as a public art piece on a plaza, with a large screen displaying real-time video stream of the scenery in front of it and transforming people‚Äôs face into geometric shapes/emojis/popular stickers.
It is a representation of the emerging and future virtual world, which helps people disguise themselves as other personalities, but also effaces individual differences. Trust is hard to build. The power of the mass is weak and dispersive.

### Technical Features
- Real-time face detection & recognition
- shape/image-face matching (size, brightness, etc.)

### References
#### Face ‚Üí geometric shapes

## Final Deliverables
- Two groups of .pde files: one changes faces to geometric shapes, the other transfers them to characterless faces
- Sketches with name ‚Äú‚Ä¶_camera‚Äù will be the one being employed on site.
- Sketches with name ‚Äú‚Ä¶_video‚Äù are demos of the effects.
